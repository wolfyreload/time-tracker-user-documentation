Every time you focus on a new window Time Tracker takes a screenshot and captures the new window title and application path. After using the tool for a few hours, you'll easily be able to figure out what you did for the day To capture time hover over the Start section until you find time what you wish to capture, click on the item that you wish to capture time for. Next hover over the time in the End capture area and click on the end of the activity that you want to capture time for. Tip Make use of the screenshots to help determine what you did. Now that you have selected the start and end time for the activity, either click on the Allocate Time button or select any area in the Capture line. Fill in what you did during that time period. In my case I was working on the documentation for this tool. Once you have filled in everything click on the Save button. Now that you have allocated your time it will show up in blue on the Capture line. Tip You can capture additional time with to any time that you previously captured by just selecting a new Start and End time and then selecting the blue capture line of an existing Client/Project/Activity. Tip You can search for any part of the application path, window title, client name, project name or activity name by using the global searchbox in the top right hand corner Once you are done for the day you can easily see what activities you spent your day on by simply clicking on the Summary button. You can adjust the application settings by selecting the Global Settings button. Sometimes you have some items that you want captured, e.g. a password spreadsheet, or a sensitive email. To exclude screenshots for specific applications simply add an exclusion by clicking on the Exclusions button.","title":"Capture Screen"},{"location":"capture-screen/#introduction","text":"Time Tracker tracks the duration of the currently focused window title and application path.
